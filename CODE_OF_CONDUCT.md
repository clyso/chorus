# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, the maintainers of Chorus, pledge to foster an open and welcoming environment for all contributors, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the Chorus community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal/political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities
The Chorus maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions (e.g., comments, code, issues, or PRs) that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and may temporarily or permanently ban contributors for inappropriate, threatening, or harmful behavior.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channels related to Chorus. It also applies when an individual represents the project in public spaces (e.g., events or social media).

## Enforcement
To report instances of abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior, contact the maintainers at <info@clyso.com> or through GitHub issues. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers will maintain confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident, to the extent possible, and will strive to ensure a safe and inclusive environment.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html.

Thank you for helping make the Chorus community a welcoming and respectful place!
