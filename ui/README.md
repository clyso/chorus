# Chorus UI

Chorus UI is the user interface for **Chorus**, designed to manage and interact with the storage system. It is built using Vue 3, TypeScript, and Pinia for state management. The UI relies on the [@clyso/clyso-ui-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@clyso/clyso-ui-kit), which is based on the Naive UI library, providing a set of pre-built components for the application.
